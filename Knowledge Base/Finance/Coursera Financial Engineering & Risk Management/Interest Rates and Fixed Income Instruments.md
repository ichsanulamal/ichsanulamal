## Simple and compound interest
**Definition**. An amount $A$ invested for n periods at a **simple interest** rate of $r$per period is worth $A(1 + n r)$ at maturity.
**Definition**. An amount $A$ invested for n periods at a **compound interest** rate of $r$ per period is worth $A(1 +r)^n$ at maturity.
Interest rates are typically quoted on **annual basis**, even if the compounding period is less than 1 year.
- $n$ compounding periods in each year
- rate of interest $r$
- $A$ invested for $y$ years yields $A (1 + \frac{r}{n}) ^{yn}$
**Definition**. **Continuous compounding** corresponds to the situation where the length of the compounding period goes to zero. Therefore, an amount $A$ invested for $y$ years is worth $\lim_{x\to\infty} A(1+ \frac{r}{n})^{yn} = Ae^{ry}$ at maturity
