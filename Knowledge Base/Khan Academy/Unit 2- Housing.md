# [**Mortgages**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/housing/mortgages-tutorial/v/introduction-to-mortgage-loans)
## **Introduction to mortgage loans**
- Setting: Fixed mortgage calculator on the left, spreadsheet titled "Prepayment" on the right.
- SAL's objective: Explain what a mortgage is, delve into the numbers, differentiate between interest and loan repayment.
- Example scenario: SAL wants to buy a $500,000 house, has $125,000 savings, needs a $375,000 loan from the bank.
- Title Transfer: Bank holds the home title as security until the loan is paid off (mortgage origin - Old French "dead pledge").
- Mortgage Loan: Refers to the loan itself; introduces a downloadable spreadsheet for mortgage calculations.
- Spreadsheet Assumptions (in brown): Interest rate (5.5%), home purchase price ($500,000), down payment (25% or $125,000), loan amount ($375,000), term (30 years), marginal tax rate (35%).
- Monthly Interest Rate: Calculated as the annual rate divided by 12 (compounded monthly).
- Mortgage Payment: Using assumptions, monthly payment calculated as approximately $2,129.21.
- Balance Sheet: Illustrates the house as an asset ($500,000), loan as a liability ($375,000), resulting in equity ($125,000).
- Loan Repayment Visualization: Over 30 years, payments shift from interest-heavy to principal-heavy, reducing debt.
- Interest Tax Deduction: Explained as a benefit where interest paid is tax-deductible but clarified as a deduction from income, not a direct reduction in taxes.
- Spreadsheet Calculation: SAL demonstrates how tax deductions are calculated using assumptions and monthly interest payments.
- Encouragement: Viewers invited to explore the spreadsheet, modify assumptions, and observe changes in the mortgage structure based on different variables.
## **Mortgage interest rates**
- **Narrator's Explanation of Buying a House:**
    - People usually need to borrow money when buying a house.
    - Example scenario: House priced at $200,000, with $40,000 saved for a down payment.
    - Need to borrow $160,000 as a mortgage loan.
- **Types of Mortgage Loans:**
    - **1. 30-Year Fixed Mortgage:**
        - Payments and interest rate are fixed over 30 years.
        - Monthly payments illustrated with a bar graph.
        - Initial payments are mostly interest, gradually shifting towards paying off the loan.
    - **2. 15-Year Fixed Mortgage:**
        - Similar to the 30-year fixed but paid off in 15 years.
        - Higher monthly payments compared to the 30-year fixed.
    - **3. 5/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM):**
        - Hybrid ARM with a fixed rate for the first 5 years.
        - After 5 years, the interest rate can change annually based on an index.
        - Monthly payments illustrated with variations, subject to potential changes after the initial fixed period.
- **Interest Rate Risks:**
    - 30-year fixed rates are higher due to the extended fixed period.
    - Banks consider risks, including the risk of interest rates rising during a fixed period.
    - Down payment and interest rate adjustments mitigate risks for banks.
- **Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) Details:**
    - The 5/1 ARM example explained:
        - Initial 5 years have a fixed interest rate.
        - Afterward, the interest rate can change annually.
        - The new rate is determined by an index (e.g., 10-year treasury rate) plus a premium.
        - Potential risks and uncertainties associated with changing interest rates.
- **Importance of Reading Loan Details:**
    - Emphasis on reading fine details, especially for exotic loans like ARMs, interest-only loans, or option ARMs.
## **Short sale basics**
- **House Purchase Overview:**
    - House bought for $200,000 with a 25% down payment ($50,000) and a $150,000 bank loan.
    - Monthly payments cover both loan repayment and interest.
- **Financial Difficulty Scenario:**
    - Circumstances like job loss or financial overestimation lead to payment difficulties.
    - Options:
        - **1. Sale:** Attempt to sell the house.
        - **2. Foreclosure:** Surrender the house to the bank, a less favorable option.
- **Challenges in Selling the House:**
    - Housing market deflated, receiving low offers (e.g., $120,000).
    - Potential real estate commission deductions reduce the net amount.
- **Short Sale as an Option:**
    - Selling the house for less than the outstanding loan amount.
    - Negotiation with the bank for forgiveness of the remaining balance.
    - Bank may or may not agree; no obligation to hide the transaction from credit agencies.
- **Credit and Tax Implications:**
    - Short sale could negatively impact credit.
    - Forgiveness of the remaining loan balance might be considered taxable income.
    - Negotiation may include requesting the bank not to report to credit agencies.
- **Considerations for Short Sale:**
    - Homeowner must be cautious and negotiate with the bank.
    - Short sale preferable to foreclosure, which has its own downsides.
    - Potential tax implications need to be addressed during negotiation.
## **Adjustable rate mortgages ARMs**
- **Introduction:**
    - Exploration of mechanics of Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) in comparison to Fixed Rate Mortgages.
    - Consideration of situations where an ARM might be advantageous or not for homebuyers.
- **Mechanics of Fixed Rate Mortgage:**
    - Fixed interest rate throughout the loan term (e.g., 4%).
    - Monthly payments have a constant rate, though the interest amount decreases over time as the principal is paid.
- **Mechanics of Adjustable Rate Mortgage:**
    - Interest rate adjusts periodically based on an index (e.g., one-year Treasuries).
    - Scenario presented where ARM starts at 2%, adjusting annually.
- **Interest Rate Adjustment:**
    - Example of interest rate adjustment over three years presented.
    - Possible scenarios of interest rate increase, leading to higher ARM rates.
    - Caps may limit the increase in certain scenarios.
- **Interest Rate Risk:**
    - Explanation of interest rate risk and its association with ARM.
    - Borrowers bear the risk in an ARM scenario, as payments can increase if interest rates rise.
    - Contrast with Fixed Rate Mortgages where lenders bear the risk of potentially lower profits if interest rates increase.
- **Predictability and Interest Rate Risk:**
    - Fixed Rate Mortgages offer predictability in payments.
    - Adjustable Rate Mortgages are less predictable, subject to interest rate fluctuations.
- **Interest Rate Risk Allocation:**
    - ARM: Borrower takes on the risk, potentially benefiting from lower rates but facing increased payments if rates rise.
    - Fixed Rate: Lender takes on the risk, risking potentially lower profits if rates increase.
- **Conclusion:**
    - The concept of interest rate risk explained, emphasizing the role of borrowers and lenders in different mortgage scenarios.
## **Hybrid ARM**
- The video discusses Hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Hybrid ARMs), which are a mix of Fixed Rate Mortgages and Adjustable Rate Mortgages.
- A Hybrid ARM typically has a fixed rate for an initial period, such as the first 5 years, and then becomes adjustable.
- The example given is a 5-1 Hybrid ARM, where the mortgage behaves like a fixed-rate mortgage for the first 5 years and then becomes adjustable.
- The rationale behind a Hybrid ARM is to provide a period of payment stability for borrowers (first 5 years fixed) while allowing the lender and borrower to share the interest rate risk.
- Borrowers might opt for a Hybrid ARM if they plan to sell or refinance the property within the fixed period, taking advantage of potentially lower initial interest rates.
- The video explains that during the fixed period, the borrower is protected, and after that, the interest rate adjusts based on market conditions.
- Lenders may prefer Hybrid ARMs because they take on less interest rate risk during the fixed period, sharing the risk with the borrower after the adjustment period begins.
- The decision to choose a Hybrid ARM depends on factors such as the borrower's confidence in managing variable interest rates, future property plans, and potential advantages like lower initial rates.
- The video emphasizes that a Hybrid ARM is a compromise between Fixed Rate Mortgages and Adjustable Rate Mortgages, offering a balance of payment stability and flexibility based on the borrower's scenario.
## **Balloon payment mortgage**
- The graph depicts a hand-drawn stacked column chart illustrating payments on a 30-year fixed mortgage.
- The mortgage has a fixed monthly payment of $1432, with a loan amount of $300,000.
- Payments are shown for each month, with the majority initially going towards interest and gradually shifting towards principal over the 30-year period.
- The term "amortization" is introduced, indicating the spreading out of payments over the 30-year period.
- The video transitions to discussing balloon payment mortgages, where the term of the loan (e.g., 10 years) differs from the amortization period (e.g., 30 years).
- After the initial term, the borrower must pay back the remaining principal, illustrated by an example of $236,352 remaining after 10 years.
- Balloon payment mortgages are explained as a way to share interest rate risk between the bank and the borrower.
- Borrowers may opt for a balloon payment mortgage if they anticipate selling the property within the initial term or if they expect a financial windfall.
- The option to take out another loan after the initial term is discussed, with considerations for credit history and income.
- The video concludes by noting that while balloon payment mortgages are less common than fixed or adjustable-rate mortgages, they do exist and can be an interesting option to explore.
## **Finite geometric series word problem: mortgage**
- Sal introduces the video as an exploration of the mathematical aspects of mortgage loans rather than a finance-focused discussion.
- He poses a fundamental question about how mortgage payments are calculated when taking out a loan for a house.
- Using a hypothetical example of a $200,000 mortgage loan with a 6% annual interest rate compounded monthly over 30 years (360 months), Sal delves into the mathematical details of the payment process.
- The process involves compounding interest and deducting monthly payments, repeating for 360 months.
- Sal presents the formula for the mortgage payment (P) and expresses it in abstract terms with variables: L (loan amount), I (monthly interest rate), N (number of months), and P (monthly mortgage payment).
- He establishes the abstract formula as a complex equation involving compounding and payments repeated for N months, resulting in the equation L = P * (1/ (1 + I) + 1/ (1 + I)^2 + ... + 1/ (1 + I)^N).
- Sal explores a geometric series and introduces a simplifying definition: R = 1/(1 + I). The geometric series equation becomes S = R - R^(N+1) / (1 - R).
- Utilizing this, Sal rewrites the mortgage equation as L = P * (R - R^(N+1) / (1 - R)).
- He then solves for P, providing the final formula for calculating the mortgage payment: P = L * (1 - R) / (R - R^(N+1)).
- Applying the formula to a scenario with a $200,000 loan, 6% annual interest, and a 30-year term, Sal calculates the monthly mortgage payment to be approximately $1200.
- Sal concludes by emphasizing that the video provides insight into the mathematical process behind determining mortgage payments, eliminating the need for tables or spreadsheets for experimentation.
