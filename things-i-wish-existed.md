- mosque social credit system

this things i have written in college, and tried to share with some friends. but i think no one reed it because most not feel relevant. 

its just digitization of mosque or any religion system so we can monitor it like stock market. 

the idea is simply AI totalitarianism in much more open way. waste my little time obsessed with this, but i think it will fail since its a top down approach. so i just postpone / drop this. but really i wish this exist. 

you can check this for my full writing

- ethical buying platform

most people wont care about the history or ideological things related to the products they buy. some just want cheap things and dont realize these things: some products cheap because it use low paid slavery labor; some products hurt the environment by lots of exploitation; the background of the founder/ stock holder is supporting genocide try to monopoly things in unhealthy way (its reallly subjective but there are lots of indicators we can use); the person that have power in that org/business has political agenda that serve only for themselves and against your value. 

most people i believe dont realize this. so what i really wish to exist is media/platform to influence purchasing behaviour, to reduce harm, to improve equality (we know some org who is richer so we avoid purchasing from them so we dont increase social/economical gaps), 

the things that they do simply can make people scan the things they buy (its harder when you buy from local/traditional market) so this is why we need more modernized the market so that the data will reliable, accurate, consistent. and then they can see historical controversy or scandal from any entity related to it. perhaps we could do scoring, but here's the tricky things about the methodology of scoring. 

- personal agent to track everything

i find it hard to track/monitor all of part of my body and action. journaling about the day is wasting time as i only write when i feel like to write. smart band only capture part of walking count, sleeping habits, stress, but i am lazy to wear it everytime, need something simpler that embedded in my body directly to track what im doing everytime. but its so hard i guess. it will give all the movement/action from ourselves, like journaling it more structured way, so the data is clean, connect it AI, ask what are our goals and just help us to try to achieve those goals. its quite interesting problems to solve i guess. but im lazy to execute.

- auto warist 

i think i will die young, but lots of my assets, some is in decentralized way so there is not central authority that manage that and im afraid my asset will just go loss without someone that get benefit from it. what i need is tools, to track my family or friends, and then if i am proved that i die or not active in that system in a specific maximum period, it will just auto transfer any asset i have: account access, password manager, cloud storage, real assets like house, etc. it can use blockchain (oops buzzword) but blockchain now is mostly  very expensive and just wasting resources. but yeah i believe its blockchain use case. the asset that is transferred, if possible follow the rules like warist in islam or custom wasiat for anyone and it transfer specific part and percentage of the assets. but yeah there are lots of things to do. 

PS. i think this is my Hammer Tool Bias because i work in data related things, i want to automate things, while maybe some just dont need that much automation, maybe we can just trust people. but i believe there are lots of hidden fear and motive when i think about this e.g., i rarely connect, engage, interact with people so i suspect theres no one knows me when i die, so thats why i need auto warist. and the other is similar like that. but yeah if it can exist, why not? no one will be hurt if those things exist. right? right? i dont know hehe.
