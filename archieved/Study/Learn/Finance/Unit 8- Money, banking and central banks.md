# [**Quantitative easing**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/federal-reserve/v/fed-open-market-operations)
## **Fed open market operations**
- Banks, like bank A and bank B, lend out most of the money they receive as deposits, keeping some as reserves, partly due to regulatory requirements.
- Bank B might face a situation where more depositors want their money back, depleting its reserves, while bank A may have excess cash.
- In such a scenario, bank A may lend some of its reserves to bank B, charging an interest rate, usually on a per-day basis.
- The Federal Reserve, represented as the Fed, may aim to stimulate the economy by injecting money and lowering short-term interest rates.
- The Fed conducts open market operations, buying treasuries from the market or directly from banks, infusing cash into the banking system.
- The cash from the sale of treasuries is deposited in banks, increasing the overall cash supply in the banking system.
- With more cash available, the demand for borrowing decreases, leading to a lower interest rate for short-term loans.
- The Fed's open market operation successfully achieves its goals of injecting cash into the economy and reducing short-term interest rates.
- The impact of these actions can be observed in the yield curve, with a shift in short-term yields from, for example, 5% to 4% due to the open market operation.
## **Quantitative easing**
- The Fed typically controls economic activity by targeting the federal funds rate during normal times.
- The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend money to each other on an overnight basis, and the Fed intervenes if this rate deviates from its target.
- Open market operations involve the Fed buying short-term treasuries from the market to increase cash circulation, lower demand for cash, and decrease interest rates.
- The Fed prefers short-term treasuries for these operations due to lower risk and may use repurchase agreements for temporary agreements.
- As the Fed lowers interest rates, possibly down to 0%, and traditional open market operations become limited, it may shift to quantitative easing.
- Quantitative easing involves buying different types of securities, such as longer-term treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, or even corporate debt.
- The goal of quantitative easing is to inject cash into the system, control the yield curve, and make various markets more operational.
- Unlike traditional open market operations, quantitative easing doesn't focus on a target rate as the federal funds rate is already at zero.
- The Fed's intervention in longer-term debt and non-traditional securities to stimulate the economy is referred to as quantitative easing.
## **More on quantitative easing (and credit easing)**
- Ben Bernanke discussed quantitative easing in the American context, particularly during the financial crisis.
- He referred to a speech on January 13th, 2009, where he mentioned the Fed's approach, termed "credit easing," resembling quantitative easing in certain aspects.
- In "credit easing," the central bank expands its balance sheet, creating more liabilities (e.g., notes outstanding) by printing money.
- Bernanke explained the mechanics of printing money, where the central bank creates offsetting liabilities and assets, such as federal reserve notes.
- Traditional quantitative easing involves increasing the central bank's balance sheet without specific focus on the use of the printed money.
- Bernanke compared this to the Bank of Japan's approach, where the emphasis was solely on the quantity of bank reserves during quantitative easing.
- The Federal Reserve's "credit easing" approach differs as it focuses on the mix of loans and securities held, aiming to impact credit conditions for households and businesses.
- Unlike traditional quantitative easing, the Fed is concerned not only with the amount of money printed but also with where that money is directed and its impact on various markets.
- Bernanke highlighted the Fed's focus on the composition of assets in the balance sheet, using interventions to influence specific markets, such as lowering interest rates for AAA corporate debt or mortgage-backed securities.
- The goal is to ease liquidity in targeted areas of the economy by strategically deploying the cash created through quantitative easing.
## **Open market operations and quantitative easing overview**
- Traditional open-market operations involve the Federal Reserve printing money to buy short-term treasury securities in the open market.
- The purpose is to increase demand for treasuries, raise their prices, and lower interest rates. The printed money is then deposited in banks, increasing the money supply.
- As money enters the banking system, the demand for reserves goes down, leading to a decrease in the overnight borrowing rate between banks (federal funds rate).
- The federal funds rate is the target rate set by the Fed for overnight borrowing of reserves between banks.
- In situations where the federal funds rate is already at 0, but the Fed wants to inject more money into the economy in a targeted way, it adopts quantitative easing.
- Quantitative easing involves the Fed printing money but using it to buy different assets, such as longer-term treasuries or mortgage-backed securities.
- The goal of quantitative easing is not just to increase the money supply but to address issues in specific markets, smoothing over disruptions or logjams.
- Quantitative easing aims to influence and stabilize certain parts of the market by strategically deploying the printed money.
## **Another quantitative easing video**
- In a scenario where the United States economy is entering a recession or facing a severe downturn, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve takes action.
- The initial step involves lowering the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
- Lowering the federal funds rate is achieved by printing money as the Federal Reserve and using it to purchase short-term treasury securities, leading to increased money supply and reduced demand for reserves, ultimately lowering the federal funds rate.
- If the economic situation persists, and the federal funds rate approaches 0%, the Chairman may opt for an unconventional strategy known as quantitative easing.
- Quantitative easing entails printing money but instead of buying short-term debt, the focus shifts to purchasing other assets like longer-term treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, or commercial debt.
- The objective of quantitative easing is not just to target interest rates but to inject money into circulation and address issues in specific markets, such as credit markets facing logjams during economic crises.
- In the perspective of Ben Bernanke, the former Chairman, this strategy is referred to as "credit easing," distinguishing it from traditional quantitative easing by emphasizing the targeted purchase of assets to alleviate logjams in credit markets.
## **US and Japanese quantitative easing**
- During Japan's banking and debt crisis in the 1990s, the initial response was to lower the target interest rate by printing money, with the central bank buying short-term government securities to increase currency and reserves in circulation.
- As Japan reached a 0% interest rate and couldn't lower it further, the next step was to continue printing money but shift focus from short-term debt to purchasing other assets like long-term Japanese treasuries and corporate debt.
- The primary goal was to increase the quantity of money in circulation, employing a strategy akin to pure quantitative easing.
- The Japanese approach involved buying various assets with the intent of getting money into circulation, addressing logjams in credit markets.
- Similarly, when faced with the U.S. credit crisis, Ben Bernanke adopted a comparable strategy, starting with lowering short-term interest rates by buying short-term securities.
- When short-term rates hit 0%, Bernanke, like Japan, continued printing money but directed it towards buying assets traditionally outside the Fed's purview.
- Bernanke refers to this strategy as "credit easing," emphasizing that, although mechanically similar to quantitative easing, the intent is different. The focus is on addressing issues in specific markets, such as commercial debt or mortgage-backed securities, rather than solely increasing the money supply for its own sake.
# [**Geithner plan**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/geithner-plan/v/geithner-plan-i)
## **Geithner plan 1**
- Geithner and the Obama administration share details on their plan to save banks.
- Simplifying the issue, a bank holds a toxic asset backed by risky mortgages.
- Banks are reluctant to sell the assets for less than the original price to avoid negative equity.
- The government's initial plan, TARP 1, involved buying these assets at a higher price, which faced criticism as a potential bailout for irresponsible parties.
- The new plan involves partnering with private investors. Private investors contribute funds, matched by the Treasury, and the Fed provides a loan to acquire the assets.
- Private investors determine the asset price through an auction.
- The government takes the first hit in case of losses, making it more attractive for private investors.
- The private investor can benefit from the upside if the asset's value increases, while losses are limited.
- The viability of the plan raises questions if investors believe the assets are worth less than the government's suggested price.
## **Geithner plan 2**
- The speaker discusses a banking crisis where a bank holds toxic assets worth $100, with $60 in liabilities and $40 in equity.
- Due to market conditions, the bank can't sell the assets for the desired price, risking bankruptcy.
- The proposed solution involves a public-private partnership, where a new entity is formed with $5 from a private investor, $5 from the Treasury, and $50 borrowed from the Federal Reserve.
- This new entity, capitalized at $60, buys the toxic assets from the bank, providing liquidity for the bank.
- The private investor takes the risk in hopes of making a profit if the assets appreciate, sharing the upside with the Treasury.
- The speaker raises concerns about the likelihood of the assets appreciating and suggests that the plan might result in a significant wealth transfer from taxpayers to banks.
- The speaker criticizes the potential for banks to manipulate the system by creating a separate entity, borrowing money from the government, and controlling the pricing of their own assets.
- A suggestion is made to wipe out bank shareholders, recapitalize the banks, and distribute shares to the public instead of providing a large wealth transfer to those responsible for the crisis.
- The speaker expresses concern about the implications of such a plan and emphasizes the need for public awareness and scrutiny.
## **Geithner plan 3**
- Geithner's second video explores a scenario where a bank reduces its exposure to a toxic asset without being an affiliate, using a hypothetical balance sheet.
- Describes a situation where a bank sells credit default swaps (CDS) on a toxic asset (Asset A) to a hedge fund, creating a $7 exposure through a CDS liability.
- The hedge fund then invests in the Geithner Plan, contributing $7 to the equity, alongside $7 from the Treasury and $86 from the Fed, resulting in $100 to buy toxic assets.
- If Asset A performs well, the hedge fund benefits from the Geithner Plan, while if it defaults, the hedge fund claims $7 from the bank through the CDS.
- Suggests this economic maneuver achieves the same outcome as the Geithner Plan without being an affiliate, using CDS sales to indirectly facilitate the desired transaction.
- Raises concerns about the potential exploitation of the plan's incentives and the lack of safeguards against such behavior.
## **Geithner plan 4**
- Explains participation in the new Treasury Public Private Program.
- Describes the program structure: 85% Fed loan, 15% private investor and Treasury equity split.
- Emphasizes the split of upside and downside between private investor and Treasury.
- Proposes a strategy to maximize upside while limiting downside by setting aside cash.
- Uses an example where the private investor would typically pay $30 for a security.
- Allocates 15% ($4.50) for the program and sets aside the remaining $25.50 in cash.
- Demonstrates the investment scenarios and potential outcomes based on the eventual value of the securities.
- Illustrates a payoff diagram comparing the proposed strategy with a traditional straight-up investment.
- Concludes with the idea that the government is providing a form of insurance or subsidy, setting the stage for further analysis in the next video.
## **Geithner plan 5**
- The speaker discusses a scenario in which the upside in an investment is maximized, while the downside is limited to 15% of the investment or $25.50.
- A correction is made regarding a previous video, clarifying that the correct downside limit was $25.50, not $24.50.
- The strategy involves setting aside $25.50, using $4.50 for participation in a plan, having the Treasury and Fed contribute, and ultimately buying $60 worth of security instead of paying $30 upfront.
- The speaker presents a payoff diagram, illustrating that losses are limited to $4.50 in any scenario where the security's value is less than $25.50.
- A comparison is made between the described strategy and a conventional approach using an insurance contract (put option) to achieve a similar payoff structure.
- The speaker emphasizes the government's role in providing a put option with a $25.50 strike price, estimating the subsidy's value using an options calculator.
- Theoretical calculations suggest the subsidy could be in the $15-$20 range, indicating the benefit given to private investors.
- The speaker questions the effectiveness of the government's plan, suggesting that rational investors might not pay the prices needed for banks to benefit.
- Concerns are raised about potential transfers of wealth from taxpayers to banks or hedge funds through the government's intervention.
- The speaker hints at addressing liquidity concerns in the next video and proposes alternative solutions to the financial crisis.
## **Geithner plan 6: A better solution**
- Recent videos critique the Geithner Plan, highlighting its potential shortcomings.
- Market willing to pay $30 for a security, even with the government's free put option.
- Rational investors may only be willing to pay $40 to $50, falling short of the banks' needs.
- Banks unwilling to sell below $60; selling at lower prices could render them insolvent.
- Geithner Plan criticized for potential ineffectiveness.
- Alternative scenario: Banks creating off-balance-sheet investors to buy assets at higher prices.
- Emphasis on the illiquidity of the market due to forced sellers and limited buyers.
- Geithner and the plan given some credit for addressing the issue of forced selling.
- Argument for increased transparency on toxic securities to expand the pool of potential buyers.
- Suggested solution involves creating corporations for these assets, increasing investor accessibility.
- Proposal to list these corporations on traditional exchanges, expanding the pool of investors.
- Lack of transparency in toxic assets highlighted; calls for a government-driven initiative.
- Suggestion to disintermediate rating agencies; government should provide detailed information.
- Proposal for a website offering transparency on toxic securities, including geographical breakdown.
- Addressing the problem of opaque 800-page documents, making information easily accessible.
- Increased transparency would attract more investors and solve liquidity issues.
- Enhanced market information, continuous trading, and accurate mark-to-market valuations proposed.
- Conclusion: Expose everything to sunlight for a market that reflects true asset values.
- Advocacy for allowing market forces to determine the fate of insolvent banks.
# [**Foreign exchange and trade**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/currency-tutorial/v/currency-exchange-introduction)
## **Currency exchange introduction**
- Objective: Explain the functioning of a currency market intuitively.
- Clarification of currency terms: Renminbi and yuan (unit of the renminbi) in the context of Chinese currency.
- Hypothetical scenario: Exchange rate of 10 yuan per U.S. dollar.
- Scenario setup: 1,000 yuan needs to be converted to dollars; $200 needs to be converted to yuan.
- Actors involved: Person with 1,000 yuan, two people with $100 each to convert.
- Market imbalance: More demand to convert dollars into yuan than yuan into dollars.
- Attempt to exchange at quoted rates: Expectation that $200 can be converted into 2,000 yuan; however, only 1,000 yuan is available for trade.
- Market adjustment: Seller offers 100 yuan for $10; one person accepts, triggering a shift in the exchange rate to 9 yuan per dollar.
- Continuous adjustment: Due to an imbalance, the person with yuan keeps offering fewer yuan per dollar until all currencies are exchanged.
- Result: No fixed formula dictates the exchange rate; it fluctuates based on supply and demand. More demand for yuan raises its price and lowers the value of the dollar.
- Takeaway: Foreign exchange rates are determined by supply and demand dynamics, with market forces dictating the fluctuations based on imbalances in currency demand and supply.
## **Currency effect on trade**
- The video explores how trade imbalances are theoretically resolved by freely floating currencies.
- Initially, the exchange rate between Chinese yuan and U.S. dollar is 10:1.
- Two entrepreneurs are introduced, one in China and one in the U.S.
- The Chinese entrepreneur sells dolls for 10 yuan each, needing to cover costs in yuan.
- The U.S. entrepreneur sells cola for $1 each, needing to cover costs in dollars.
- Demand for 100 dolls in the U.S. and demand for 50 cans of cola in China are established.
- A trade imbalance develops, with $100 worth of dolls shipped to the U.S. and $50 worth of cola shipped to China.
- The Chinese entrepreneur wants to convert $100 into yuan, while the U.S. entrepreneur wants to convert 500 yuan into dollars.
- The imbalance creates more demand for yuan than dollars.
- This leads to an adjustment in exchange rates, with the yuan becoming more expensive (8 yuan to $1).
- As a result, the Chinese dolls become more expensive in dollars, and the U.S. cola becomes cheaper in yuan.
- This shift in prices reduces demand for dolls in the U.S. (from 100 to 50) and increases demand for cola in China (from 50 to 80).
- The trade imbalance is eventually resolved through currency adjustments, impacting the demand for exports in each country.
## **Currency effect on trade review**
- Video focuses on reviewing the concepts discussed in the previous video.
- Started with an exchange rate of CNY 10 per dollar.
- Described the scenario where a Chinese manufacturer sells dolls for CNY 10 and a U.S. manufacturer sells cola for $1.
- Discussed the imbalance in currency conversion demands: Chinese manufacturer wants to convert $100 into CNY 1,000, but there's only CNY 500 available; U.S. manufacturer wants to convert CNY 500 into $50, and there's more demand for Yuan than dollars.
- Analyzed the impact on currency prices, highlighting that the price of the dollar decreases in terms of Yuan.
- Introduced a hypothetical exchange rate of CNY 8 per dollar.
- Explored the consequences of the new exchange rate on the prices of goods: dolls become $1.25 each, and cola becomes CNY 8 per can.
- Adjusted demand for dolls in the U.S. to 60 and for cola in China to 75 cans.
- Calculated the trade balance: China exports 60 dolls ($75) to the U.S., and the U.S. exports 75 cans (CNY 600) to China.
- Demonstrated that the supply and demand for both currencies are now balanced.
- Emphasized the idea that freely floating currencies lead to a natural adjustment until trade balances are achieved.
- Previewed the next video, which will discuss how a government, particularly the Chinese Central Bank, could intervene to prevent such imbalances and maintain a trade advantage.
## **Pegging the yuan**
- Recap of the previous video, highlighting the imbalance in trade between China and the U.S. where China was shipping more goods than the U.S.
- Introduced the scenario where the Chinese government aims to maintain an exchange rate of CNY 10 per dollar to continue exporting more to the U.S.
- Discussed the Chinese Central Bank's role in intervening to keep the Yuan devalued by printing money.
- Explained how the Central Bank can print CNY 500 to balance the demand for CNY 1,000, ensuring a steady supply of Yuan to be converted into dollars.
- Emphasized that this intervention allows the Chinese government to accumulate more dollars to sustain the trade imbalance.
- Highlighted the challenge for China as they need to keep printing Yuan and accumulating more dollars to maintain the desired trade dynamics.
- Teased the next video, where the use of accumulated dollars will be discussed, along with its potential impact on the U.S. economy, and hinted at the difficulty of unwinding this scenario once it begins.
## **Chinese Central Bank buying treasuries**
- Recap of the current exchange rate scenario, with the Chinese government wanting to peg the exchange rate at 10 yuan per U.S. dollar.
- Explanation of the trade imbalance where more goods are being exported from China to the U.S. than the other way around.
- Visual representation of the trade dynamics between China and the U.S., with Chinese goods being sold in the U.S. and paid for in dollars, and U.S. goods being sold in China and paid for in yuan.
- Discussion of the imbalance in currency demand and supply, especially with the assumed peg at 10 yuan per dollar.
- Explanation of how the Chinese Central Bank intervenes to maintain the peg, buying excess dollars and printing extra yuan to balance the demand and supply.
- Introduction to the concept that the Chinese Central Bank accumulates dollars and needs to actively participate in the market to maintain the peg, emphasizing the ongoing intervention required.
- Explanation of the Chinese Central Bank's strategy to convert excess dollars into safe U.S. assets, particularly U.S. Treasuries, due to their safety and liquidity.
- Clarification that buying U.S. Treasuries essentially means lending money to the U.S. government, with Treasuries being IOUs from the U.S. government.
- Teaser for the next video, suggesting a discussion on the implications of a large holder of U.S. dollars buying Treasuries and its potential impact on interest rates and the broader U.S. economy.
## **American-Chinese debt loop**
- Recap of the Chinese Central Bank's strategy from the previous videos, aiming to prevent the appreciation of the yuan by buying excess dollars using printed yuan.
- Visual representation of the process where the Chinese Central Bank prints yuan and uses it to buy dollars in the open market, propping up the demand for dollars and keeping the yuan's value low.
- Explanation of the continuous need for the Chinese Central Bank to intervene in the market to maintain the desired exchange rate.
- Emphasis on the accumulation of a stockpile of dollar reserves by the Chinese Central Bank, highlighting that these dollars will be used to buy liquid and safe assets, primarily U.S. Treasury bills.
- Introduction of the two potential sources from which the Chinese Central Bank can buy Treasuries: directly from the U.S. Treasury when they issue new bills or bonds, or from other investors in the open market.
- Clarification that the essence of the situation is the Chinese Central Bank printing money to buy dollars, which they then lend to the U.S. government by purchasing U.S. Treasuries.
- Transition into the impact of this action on the U.S., focusing on how it affects interest rates.
- Explanation of how having a major buyer like the Chinese Central Bank in the U.S. Treasury market lowers interest rates for treasuries, as demonstrated by a simplified borrowing scenario involving individuals lending money to a borrower.
- Elaboration on the broader implications, stating that lower interest rates on U.S. Treasuries lead to lower borrowing costs for the U.S. government, making it easier for them to finance deficits.
- Discussion of the potential effects on government spending and taxation, with lower interest costs allowing for increased spending or tax reductions.
- Explanation of how the lower interest rates on U.S. Treasuries impact the broader economy, making all forms of debt in the U.S. cheaper.
- Introduction of the idea that more available money for loans makes borrowing cheaper across the board, which stimulates economic activity.
- Conclusion that the net effect of China's actions is that they are essentially lending money to the U.S., resulting in more cash in the pockets of Americans, either through government spending, tax cuts, or easier access to credit.
## **Debt loops rationale and effects**
- The video discusses the reasons behind the actions of different actors in the economic cycle and explores the challenges of unwinding the scenario.
- Increased cash in American pockets due to cheaper debt, allowing the government to spend more and lower taxes.
- The cycle stimulates the economy by making debt cheaper and lowering interest rates.
- Potential risk of higher inflation, but the cycle keeps inflation slow due to the abundance of cheaper goods.
- China benefits from export-led growth by artificially suppressing its currency, making exports cheaper and encouraging investment in domestic production.
- Export-led growth builds a manufacturing base and a domestic consumer market in China over time.
- The U.S. loses its manufacturing base but gains lower costs for American consumers.
- Challenges arise for both China and the U.S. in unwinding the situation, as it could lead to a drop in the value of assets and an increase in interest rates.
- Unwinding the cycle could negatively impact both countries, making it difficult to break free from the current economic scenario.
- The video raises questions about the sustainability of the cycle and its long-term consequences.
## **China keeps peg but diversifies holdings**
- In 2009, the US had a significant trade deficit with China, importing $260 billion more than it exported.
- China kept its currency from appreciating by printing money and using yuan to buy dollar assets.
- In 2006-2008, there were major increases in US assets held by China, but in 2009, the increase was not enough to offset the trade imbalance.
- The People's Bank of China held $929 billion worth of US treasuries in November 2009, making it the largest holder.
- Despite the trade deficit, China's holdings of US treasuries decreased from November 2009 to November 2010.
- China may have diversified from buying US treasuries to other assets, possibly in the UK or Eurozone, to avoid excessive appreciation of its currency.
- The United Kingdom, for example, saw a significant increase in holdings from $155 billion to $500 billion in 2010, despite not having a significant trade imbalance with the US.
- China's slow appreciation of its currency may also contribute to diversification, but the main strategy seems to be moving away from dollar assets.
- Other countries acquiring non-dollar assets may then seek to buy dollar assets to prevent their currency from appreciating too much.
## **Carry trade basics**
- Country A's economy is stagnating, potentially facing a deflationary crisis.
- The central bank of country A prints money and lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy.
- An investor can borrow in country A's currency at a 1% interest rate.
- In the rest of the world, particularly in country B, safe investments can be made at a higher interest rate (5%).
- Opportunistic investors borrow in country A's currency (100 A's at a 1% interest rate).
- They exchange the borrowed currency for 200 B's in the currency market (assuming a conversion rate of 1 A to 2 B's).
- The investors then invest the 200 B's in country B at a 5% return, earning 10 B's in interest per year.
- The 10 B's can be converted back to 5 A's, paying off the 1 A interest and leaving a net gain of 4 A's per year.
- This process is known as the carry trade, taking advantage of interest rate differentials between countries.
- The carry trade can break down if country A's currency appreciates relative to country B's currency, reducing the gain in terms of the borrowed currency.
- The carry trade became famous in the mid-90s when people borrowed in Japan with low-interest rates and invested in higher-interest-rate countries like the US and Iceland.
- If many people engage in the carry trade, it can create a herd effect, leading to increased demand for the higher-interest-rate country's currency and affecting exchange rates.
# [**Chinese currency and U.S. debt**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/china-us-debt-situation/v/floating-exchange-resolving-trade-imbalance)
## Floating exchange resolving trade imbalance
- Video aims to explore how the floating exchange rate could resolve trading imbalances.
- Assumes simplified scenario: exchange rate between Chinese Yuan and US $ is 6 Yuan per 1 US $.
- China exports microwaves to the US at $50 each, demand for 1 million microwaves.
- US exports software to China at 60 Yuan per unit, demand for 2 million units.
- Chinese manufacturer earns $50 million, aims to convert into Yuan, creating supply of US dollars.
- US manufacturer earns 120 million Yuan, aims to convert into $20 million, creating demand for US dollars.
- Imbalance: Supply of $ > Demand for $, leading to potential devaluation of the dollar.
- Dollar price drop would make Yuan stronger, affecting prices: Chinese goods become costlier, US goods cheaper in China.
- Stronger Yuan reduces demand for Chinese goods and increases demand for US goods, resolving imbalance.
- This theoretical resolution is under a floating exchange rate, but reality doesn't always permit this to occur due to restrictions.
- Not feasible in reality as exchange rates aren't always allowed to float, which will be explained in future videos.
  
# [**Bitcoin**](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it)
## **Bitcoin: What is it?**
- Bitcoin is an electronic payment system facilitating transactions over the internet.
- Parties involved are referred to as Alice and Bob.
- Bitcoin transactions involve a sequence of specially constructed numbers.
- Alice can use a bitcoin client or a third-party service to initiate a transaction.
- Bob also uses software or a service to process the received numbers.
- Bitcoin has real-world value, with merchants accepting it, and exchanges converting it to mainstream currencies.
- Bitcoin's value is derived from faith in what can be procured with it.
- Bitcoin offers privacy as transactions can occur without revealing real-world identities.
- Bitcoin is open, allowing anyone with an internet connection to engage in transactions.
- Bitcoin is decentralized, with no central entity controlling the system, providing benefits like no third-party interference in transactions.
- Decentralization can raise concerns for some, as traditional authorities like banks perform essential functions that Bitcoin achieves differently.
- The upcoming series will delve into the mechanics of bitcoin transactions, explaining validation in a decentralized system.
- Bitcoin's complexity necessitates understanding its various parts to comprehend how they fit together.
## **Bitcoin: Overview**
- Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency system gaining attention.
- Bitcoin is decentralized, using a peer-to-peer network for transactions.
- Described as a cryptocurrency, cryptographic techniques facilitate bitcoin transactions.
- Bitcoin transactions resemble entries in a global ledger rather than traditional coin transactions.
- Identities like Alice and Bob in bitcoin are pseudonyms, not tied to real-world identities.
- Transactions involve specifying the bitcoins to transfer, change, and a transaction fee.
- Digital signatures bind identities to transaction details cryptographically.
- Transactions are broadcasted to all nodes in the peer-to-peer network.
- Bitcoin miners, specific nodes in the network, validate transactions and create transaction blocks.
- Transaction blocks are linked in a chain, forming a transaction block chain.
- Proof of work, a computationally intensive task, ensures difficulty and security in bitcoin mining.
- Nodes consider the transaction block chain with the most work as valid.
- Bitcoin's decentralized process eliminates the need for a central entity or bank in transactions.
## **Bitcoin: Cryptographic hash functions**
- Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental building blocks in various cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
- Common algorithms include MD5, MD4, SHA-256, SHA-1, RIPEMD, BLAKE, Skein, and others.
- They have applications in digital signatures, e-commerce protocols, bitcoin generation, message authentication, pseudorandom number generation, password security, and encryption.
- A cryptographic hash function is a deterministic transformation that takes an arbitrary-length message as input and produces a fixed-length output known as a digest.
- Examples like SHA-256 have a fixed output size of 256 bits.
- Properties of cryptographic hash functions include computational efficiency, collision resistance (difficulty finding two inputs with the same output), hiding information about inputs, and a well-distributed output resembling randomness.
- The properties are interrelated, and trade-offs may occur between them.
- Guarantees of these properties are based on the longevity and history of the hash function.
## **Bitcoin: Digital signatures**
- A digital signature combines a public sequence of numbers with a digital message, serving as the electronic analog of a physical signature.
- Well-known digital signature schemes include RSA and DSS.
- Digital signature mechanics involve a signing key (private) and a verification key (public).
- The signing process generates a signature by applying a mathematical transformation to the message and the signing key.
- Verification involves three inputs: the message, the signature, and the public verification key.
- The transformation verifies that the signature corresponds to the message and was likely produced with the private signing key.
- Digital signatures bind an identity (public verification key) to a message, resembling a traditional handwritten signature.
- Signatures depend on the message, making them different from static handwritten signatures.
- Digital signatures are often associated with cryptographic hash functions, ensuring security by signing the hash of a message.
- The hash-and-sign paradigm simplifies the process and relies on the collision resistance of the hash function for security.
## **Bitcoin: Transaction records**
- Bitcoin is essentially a chain of digital signatures representing the coin's path in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
- Conceptually, bitcoins are better understood as entries in a ledger rather than physical coins.
- Transactions involve digitally signed declarations of intent to transfer bitcoins from one party to another.
- Participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem use pseudonyms corresponding to public verification keys.
- Public keys are derived from private keys, with each participant having a unique pair.
- Transactions include references to previous transactions, creating a chain of ownership.
- Cryptographic hash functions are applied to transaction details for verification, ensuring the authenticity of ownership.
- Alice, as an example, can transfer bitcoins to Bob by specifying the transaction details and signing them with her private key.
- The transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network for validation and recording.
- The remaining unaccounted coin in a transaction is typically used as a transaction fee for miners.
- Bitcoin miners play a crucial role in validating transactions and establishing a decentralized timestamp for transaction order.
- The decentralized timestamp helps prevent double-spending and resolves disputes in the absence of a trusted third party.
## **Bitcoin: Proof of work**
- Proof of work protocols serve as a means for demonstrating significant computational effort.
- These protocols involve solving challenging puzzles that are computationally demanding and cannot be easily bypassed.
- The effort exerted in proof of work can be quickly verified.
- Applications of proof of work include Bitcoin's electronic payment system for creating transaction block chains.
- Proof of work has been proposed for deterring denial-of-service attacks and combating spam emails.
- In the context of deterring spam, a challenge string represents specific email content.
- The prover generates a proof string with specific mathematical properties in relation to the challenge, typically involving cryptographic hash functions.
- The computational effort required for proof of work can be adjusted by varying the number of leading zeros required in the output.
- Once a solution is found, the proof of work can be easily validated by hashing the challenge and proof strings to confirm the required number of leading zeros.
- Proof of work protocols are simple yet effective in establishing a mathematical relationship between a challenge and a corresponding proof string.
## **Bitcoin: Transaction block chains**
- Transaction Block Chain: Essential for understanding how Bitcoins work.
- Alice initiates a transaction by creating a signed record containing transaction details and public keys, broadcasted to the entire Bitcoin network.
- Bitcoin nodes receive transaction information and work on incorporating it into a ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.
- Nodes form transaction blocks by hashing pairs of transactions in a tree-like structure.
- Transaction blocks incorporate the previous block's hash, forming a chain dating back to the beginning of Bitcoin.
- The sequence of hashed blocks is converted into a challenge for a proof-of-work protocol.
- Miners must find a proof with a specific mathematical property, involving leading zeros in the cryptographic hash output.
- Mining difficulty adjusts to maintain an average proof-finding time of about 10 minutes.
- Once a proof is found, miners announce it to the network, and nodes work to build on top of the new block chain.
- Miners receive rewards, including new coins and transaction fees, for successfully adding a block to the chain.
- In case of multiple competing chains, the longest chain with the highest aggregate difficulty is accepted.
## **Bitcoin: The money supply**
- Bitcoin miners incorporate transactions into the global ledger known as the transaction block chain.
- Miners are rewarded with Bitcoins for their computational efforts, specifically through the construction of a coinbase transaction.
- Bitcoins are effectively generated as a reward for miners during the process.
- The maximum limit for the total number of Bitcoins in the system is set at 21 million.
- Once the limit is reached, miners will no longer receive automatic rewards for their efforts in maintaining the transaction block chain.
- Transaction fees are expected to play a more significant role as an incentive for miners after reaching the 21 million Bitcoin limit.
- Bitcoins can be fractional, with the smallest unit known as a Satoshi.
- Additional controls, such as decreasing miner rewards over time and adjusting the proof-of-work difficulty, are in place to manage the Bitcoin money supply.
- The reward for miners decreases every 210,000 blocks, with the current reward being 25 Bitcoins per mining operation.
- The Bitcoin system estimates the time to generate blocks, adjusting the proof-of-work difficulty to maintain an approximate 14-day period for 2016 blocks.
- The entire Bitcoin supply is expected to be generated by the year 2140.
- The proof-of-work protocol becomes faster as more nodes join the network, and each node works on a unique proof-of-work problem.
- The Bitcoin protocol implements measures to limit the total number of Bitcoins and control the rate at which they are generated.
## **Bitcoin: The security of transaction block chains**
- **Imaginary Bitcoin Transaction Overview:**
    - Dan wants to order a pizza from Pete's Pizza Shop using Bitcoins.
    - Pete's Pizza Shop accepts Bitcoins, and the cost is 1 Bitcoin for a pizza pie.
    - Dan received 5 Bitcoins from his cousin, Carol (C), and wants to use 1 Bitcoin for the pizza.
- **Bitcoin Transaction Process:**
    - Dan's Bitcoin client creates a transaction record, specifying the transfer of 1 Bitcoin to Pete and keeping 4 Bitcoins as change.
    - The transaction record is broadcasted to the entire Bitcoin network, including miners responsible for validating transactions.
    - Miners examine the transaction block chain, a public record of all Bitcoin transactions, to verify the legitimacy of Dan's transaction.
- **Security Measures in Bitcoin Transactions:**
    - Miners solve proof-of-work puzzles to add a transaction block to the block chain, with an average solving time of 10 minutes.
    - Difficulty scores associated with proof-of-work puzzles determine the trustworthiness of the transaction block chain.
    - The longest chain, representing the most work done, is considered the legitimate chain in case of multiple chains.
- **Potential Fraudulent Scenario:**
    - Dan attempts fraud by creating a new transaction assigning the 5 Bitcoins from Carol to a friend, Fred.
    - Dan needs to create a fork in the chain, presenting a different version of transaction history.
- **Challenges for Fraudulent Attempt:**
    - Dan faces the challenge of solving multiple proof-of-work puzzles to create a longer chain than the existing legitimate chain.
    - The likelihood of success depends on Dan's computing power compared to the combined computing power of all honest nodes in the network.
- **Security Factors in Bitcoin:**
    - Security is ensured by the mathematical difficulty of forking the block chain dishonestly.
    - Economic incentives encourage honest behavior, as miners receive rewards and transaction fees for legitimate mining.
- **Conclusion:**
    
    - The security of Bitcoin transactions is maintained through both mathematical barriers and economic motivations, making fraudulent attempts challenging and less profitable compared to honest mining.
