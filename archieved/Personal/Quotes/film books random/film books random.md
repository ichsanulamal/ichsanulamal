# Kafka on the shore
Kafka, in everybody's life there's a point of no return. And in very few cases, a point where you can't go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That's how we survive."

# Mr. Robot
If someone asked for your patience, they are asking for your surrender
You search, you find. What if you search and you dont find. How long do yo look. Eventually you have gotta be give up right
