This idea came to my mind after watching "Repeat Stuff" which I don't know whether the subliminal messages are jokes or not, but it very subtle depicts a lot of satanic quotes.
There is no right or wrong in it. Just clustering or doing unsupervised learning, or anything. I don't understand the terms because I even haven't passed my data science class.
By doing this you can see the pattern of satanic content, and prevent all conservative fellows to see those content by providing the probability of content containing those stuff or not. You can save the world by waking up people to be aware of this satanic stuffs, especially conservative people if the afterworld really exists. If you think it doesn't exist, you can do this just for fun and practice your DS/ML skills and apply your knowledge.
## Guide
- Collecting data
    
    You can collect the data with any type of form, e.g. text, website articles, songs, movies, actors, directors, videos, or anything that can be transformed into a feature to be detected by probability whether it is Illuminati or not.
