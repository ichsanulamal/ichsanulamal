Hi I'm **insert_name**, currently a corporate wagie in data & AI.  
Most of my time is spent tinkering with tech, philosophy, and finance ‚Äî often not productively, but always curiously.

Outside the job, I build systems for sovereignty and do speculative things.

If you're bored and looking for projects or sparks, check out my list of ["Things I Wish Existed"](https://ichsanulamal.github.io/posts/things-i-wish-existed/).  
Maybe we can build something weird and meaningful.
